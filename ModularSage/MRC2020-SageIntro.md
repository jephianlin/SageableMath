# Quickstart tutorial on SageMath for IEPG-ZF

[SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) (or Sage) is a free open-source mathematics software system licensed under the GPL.  This set of tutorials aims to provide a quick experience of how to use Sage to work on linear algebra and graph theory problem, in particular, the inverse quegenvalue problem of a graph (IEP-$G$) and zero forcing (ZF).  

## Installation
There are a few options:
* Use Sage on a server:  Request an account from the owner of the server, sign in, and then start to program! (e.g., Iowa State University [Sage1](https://sage.math.iastate.edu/) server)
* Install it on your own machine:  It takes some time to install, but it is worthy in the long run! (official [Download](https://www.sagemath.org/download.html) page, unofficial [installation guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PnMK_GtNfKQYyBNZiub0PmHus8-VPBw-JeN52oVElHQ/edit?usp=sharing))
* Use it on [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/):  Official free server.  Slower due to large amount of users.  There is pay option to speed up.

## ISU Server Interface
* At this moment, the ISU Sage server is on version 8.1 and has the classical Sage notebook interface.
* Once you have logged-in, open a project, type code in a cell, and press `shift + enter` to run.

## Jupyter Interface
* Sage team then have integrated their Sage Notebook experiences into the Jupyter notebook interface, which is also used by many Python programmers.
* Once you have installed Sage on your machine, there should be a shortcut to open the notebook interface.
* In a newer version, the default notebook has switched to Jupyter.
* Similarly, open a new Sage project, typo code in a cell, and press `shift + enter` to run.

## Basics
If you have time for a better understanding of basic Python/Sage syntax, you may follow the Sage Basics tutorial below.  A cheatsheet is also provided.
