\begin{document}
\maketitle 

Sageable Mathematics is a project that introduces SageMath (or Sage) to students and encourages them to program in Sage.  Each student (or each small group of students) will pick a mathematics concept and implement the computation in Sage.  The goal is to experience programming through Sage and also gain a deeper insight into the concept.
