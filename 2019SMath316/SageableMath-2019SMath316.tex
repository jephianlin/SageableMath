\title{Sageable Mathematics}
%\author{all of us}

\begin{document}
\maketitle 

Sageable Mathematics is a project that introduces SageMath (or Sage) to students and encourages them to program in Sage.  Each student (or each small group of students) will pick a mathematics concept and implement the computation in Sage.  The goal is to experience programming through Sage and also gain a deeper insight into the concept.

This document is a gallery of students' work in Math316: Practice of Applied Mathematics at National Sun Yat-sen University, in 2019 Spring.

As the instructor, I myself particularly recommend ``GradientDescent'', ``LinearClassifier'', ``MinimalPolynomial'', and ``Torque''.
