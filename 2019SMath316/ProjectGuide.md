2. On CoCalc, open Jupyter by clicking `Settings` on the top-left corner, scrolling down and clicking on `Plain Jupyter Classic Server`.  (You might need to allow pop-up windows.)
3. In Jupyter, open `main > myproject.ipynb` and change the title to the topic you picked; also, change "Jephian Lin" to your name.
3. Changed the file name of `myproject.ipynb` to a name describing your topic.  (I call it `your_topic.ipynb` for the rest of this guide.)
