### Objective
Most of the undergraduate courses in mathematics focuses on the understanding of various theories.  This is an essential part of training in math and builds a solid background for students.  However, this project asks you to focus on the __computational aspect__ of mathematics.  By doing so, you will gain a deeper understanding in the corresponding theorems.  Computers are good followers, but they do not think.  If you are able to teach a computer to do something that means you know the concept firmly.

In this project, I will teach you how to __program in Sage__.  Then you have to pick some mathematics concepts and __make them work on computers__.  You will realize that mathematics are not as abstract as you thought since many concepts are touchable through programming.  (There are some possible topics below, but you are also free to pick your favorite "computable" mathematical concepts.)  At the end, you have to write a report for what you have done with clear explanations.  We will learn how to use git to put your code on GitHub and how to put an open license to claim copyright for your code.  

### SageMath Tutorials

### Topics for Linear Algebra
* __Good Gaussian elimination:__ Write an algorithm to compute the reduced echelon form.  Record the changes in elementary matrices.  Generate a good matrix whose elimination process only has integers involved.
* __More row operations:__  Write algorithms to compute the reduced echelon form, the signature matrix in Sylvester's law of inertia, and the Smith normal form.
* __Matrix as an operator:__ Find the minimal polynomial of a matrix.  Compute the power of a matrix.  Approximate the exponential of a matrix.
* __Vector space:__ Use a Python object to represent a vector space.  Use computer to find a basis and the dimension for it.  How to find the intersection and the product of two vector spaces?  How to find the orthogonal complement of it?

### Topics for Algebra
* __Group realization:__ Use a Python object to represent a group element.  Then set up the operations in a group.
* __Subgroups:__ Find all subgroups in a group.  How many of them are normal?
* __Resultant:__ Implement the division algorithm.  Understand the resultant and find the common factor of two polynomials.  

### Topics for Analysis
