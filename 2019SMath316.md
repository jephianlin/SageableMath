### Objective
Most of the mathematics courses in college focus on the proofs of various theorems.  Learning the proofs is no doubt an essential part of training.  However, this project asks you to focus on the __computational aspect__ of mathematics.  By doing so, you will gain a deeper understanding of the corresponding concepts.  Computers are good followers, but they do not think.  If you can teach a computer to do something, then that means you know the idea firmly.

In this project, we will learn how to __program in Sage__.  Then you have to pick some mathematical concepts and __make them work on a computer__.  You will realize that mathematics is not as abstract as you thought since many concepts are touchable through programming.  (We will go through the topics for linear algebra, but you are also free to pick your favorite "computable" mathematical concepts.)  At the end, you have to write a report for what you have done with clear explanations.  We will learn how to use git to put your code on GitHub and how to put an open license to claim copyright for your code.
