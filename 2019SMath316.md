Prof. Chih-Wei Chen, Prof. Jephian C.-H. Lin, and Prof. ShengLi Tzeng help with the group discussion.

## Sageable Mathematics
Lead by Jephian Lin.

### Objective
Most of the undergraduate courses in mathematics focuses on the understanding
of various theories.  This is an essential part of training in math and builds
a solid background for students.  However, this project asks you to focus on
the computational aspect of mathematics.  By doing so, you will gain a deeper
understanding in the corresponding theorems.  Computers are good followers,
but they do not think.  If you are able to teach a computer to do something
that means you know the concept firmly.

In this project, I will teach you how to program in Sage and ask you to pick
some topics to work on them.  You will realize that mathematics are not as
abstract as you though since many concepts are touchable through programming.  
You have to write a report for what you have done with clear explanations.  
At the end, you will learn how to use git and how to put a open license to
your code.  


### Topics for Linear Algebra
* __Good Gaussian elimination:__ Write an algorithm to compute the reduced echelon form.  Record the changes in elementary matrices.  Generate a good matrix whose elimination process only has integers involved.
* __More row operations:__  Write algorithms to compute the reduced echelon form, the signature matrix in Sylvester's law of inertia, and the Smith normal form.
* __Matrix as an operator:__ Find the minimal polynomial of a matrix.  Compute the power of a matrix.  Approximate the exponential of a matrix.
* __Vector space:__ Use a Python object to represent 

### Topics for Algebra
* __Group realization:__ Use a Python object to represent a group element.  Then set up the operations in a group.
* __Subgroups:__ Find all subgroups in a group.  How many of them are normal?
* __Resultant:__ Implement the division algorithm.  Understand the resultant and find the common factor of two polynomials.  

### Topics for Analysis
* __Numerical calculus:__ Use numerical answers to approximate a limie, a series, a derivative, and a Riemann integral.
* __Limit calculator:__ Use computer to solve a limit problem.
* __Solve differential equations:__ Use computer to solve differential equations.

### Topics for Discrete Mathematics
