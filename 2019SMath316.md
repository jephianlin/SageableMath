# Math316 Practice of Applied Mathematics || National Sun Yat-sen University
This course is lead by Prof. Mong-Na Lo Huang.
Prof. Chih-Wei Chen, Prof. Jephian C.-H. Lin, and Prof. ShengLi Tzeng help with the group discussion.

## Sageable Mathematics
Lead by Jephian Lin.

### Objective
Most of the courses in math focuses on the understanding of various theories.  
This is an essential part of training in math and builds a solid background
for students.  However, sometimes we focus on these theorems too much  and
forgot that we have to use them.  This group aims to bring you a lead you to the computational mathematics  

### Topics for Linear Algebra
* __Good Gaussian elimination:__ Write an algorithm to compute the reduced echelon form.  Record the changes in elementary matrices.  Generate a good matrix whose elimination process only has integers involved.
* __More row operations:__  Write algorithms to compute the reduced echelon form, the signature matrix in Sylvester's law of inertia, and the Smith normal form.
* __Matrix as an operator:__ Find the minimal polynomial of a matrix.  Compute the power of a matrix.  Approximate the exponential of a matrix.

### Topics for Algebra
* __Group realization:__ Construct a group and ask the computer to do the group operations.  

### Topics for Analysis
* __Numerical calculus:__ Use numerical answers to approximate a limie, a series, a derivative, and a Riemann integral.
* __Limit calculator:__ Use computer to solve a limit problem.

### Topics for Discrete Mathematics
* __Graph coloring:__ Write an algorithm to color a graph.
* __Shortest paths:__ Find all shortest pathes between two vertiecs.  Find every pair of vertices with a unique shortest path.
* __Maximum matchings:__ Find the matching number.  Find all maximum matchings.
* __Graph isomorphism:__ Write an algorithm to test if two graphs are isomorphic.
