# ModularSage

This folder contains tutorials about SageMath.  The tutorials are modular and not sequential.  The topics from different files might overlap or not related at all.  In the long run, I hope to build the dependency tree so that each reader can arrange a customized course for various purposes.

## Tutorials
1. Sage Basics [1](ModularSage/Sage1.ipynb) [2](ModularSage/Sage2.ipynb) [3](ModularSage/Sage3.ipynb) [4](ModularSage/Sage4.ipynb):  Introduction to Sage.
2. Sage Special Topics: [matrix](ModularSage/Sage-Matrix.ipynb), [object](ModularSage/Sage-Object.ipynb)

## Talks
1. [SageMath on Spectral Graph Theory](ModularSage/SageMath_on_Spectral_Graph_Theory.ipynb)
